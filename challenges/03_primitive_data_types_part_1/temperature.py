celcius_100 = (100 - 32) * 5 /9
print(celcius_100)

#Created the variable which substracts 32 from 100 first by placing parentheses around that first and then multipled the resulting answer with 5/9 which resulted in the celcius answer in the float: 37.77777777778 (The response is a float because it includes a decimal point)

celsius_0 = (0 - 32) * 5 /9
print(celsius_0)

#Created the variable which substracts 32 from 0 first by placing parentheses around that and then multipled the resulting answer with 5/9 which resulted in the celcius answer in the float: -17.77777777777778

print((34.2 - 32) * 5/9)

#To ensure that the formula for farenheit to celcius conversion worked without using any variables I had to make sure that the process was carried out the same way as in the previous responses. I created the print statement to include the formula in parentheses and placed another parentheses inside the print statement to ensure that order order of the formula stayed the same. The resulting answer was: 1.2222222222222239

farenheit_5 = (5 * 9/5) + 32
print(farenheit_5)

#The conversion formula from farenheit to celsius = (Farenheit * 9/5) +32 which results in 41 degrees celcius

print((30.2 * 9/5) + 32) 
#Celcius to Farenheit conversion for 30.2 is 86.36, this means that 30.2 is hotter than 85.1 degrees
